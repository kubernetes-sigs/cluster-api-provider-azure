# maps release series of major.minor to cluster-api contract version
# the contract version may change between minor or major versions, but *not*
# between patch versions.
#
# update this file only when a new major or minor version is released
# in practice this metadata.yaml contract spec is only used to test
# one capz version at a time against one API version
