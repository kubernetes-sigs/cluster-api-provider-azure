                        This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api.
                        Example use case is cluster autoscaler with cluster-api as
                        provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines
                        to nodes to find out machines at provider which could not
                        get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                        generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is
                        required by autoscaler to be able to have a provider view
                        of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried
                        from the k8s apiserver and then a comparison is done to find
                        out unregistered machines and are marked for delete. This
                        field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher
                        level entities like autoscaler that will be interfacing with
                        cluster-api as generic provider.

                uses different field names and formatting). 2) It removes some of
                the dependency on the structure of the Node,    so that if the structure

                        Example use case is cluster autoscaler with cluster-api as

                        to nodes to find out machines at provider which could not
                        get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a

                        required by autoscaler to be able to have a provider view
                        of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried
                        from the k8s apiserver and then a comparison is done to find
                        out unregistered machines and are marked for delete. This
