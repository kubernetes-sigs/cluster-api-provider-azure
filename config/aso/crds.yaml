                                    Allowed values are 'Prefix', 'NoPrefix', and 'None'.
                                    When set to 'Prefix', the value specified in the prefix field will be
                                    prepended to the value of the JWT claim.
                                    The prefix field must be set when prefixPolicy is 'Prefix'.

                                    of the JWT claim.
                                    When set to 'None', this means no opinion and the platform is left to choose
                                    any prefixes that are applied which is subject to change over time.
                                    Currently, the platform prepends `{issuerURL}#` to the value of the JWT claim

                          with the same <major.minor> once it has been created (e.g. 1.14.x -> 1.14) will not trigger an upgrade, even if a newer
                          patch version is available. As a best practice, you should upgrade all node pools in an AKS cluster to the same
                          Kubernetes version. The node pool version must have the same major version as the control plane. The node pool minor

                    When <major.minor> is specified, the latest supported GA patch version is chosen automatically. Updating the cluster
                    with the same <major.minor> once it has been created (e.g. 1.14.x -> 1.14) will not trigger an upgrade, even if a newer
                    patch version is available. When you upgrade a supported AKS cluster, Kubernetes minor versions cannot be skipped. All
                    upgrades must be performed sequentially by major version number. For example, upgrades between 1.14.x -> 1.15.x or
                    1.15.x -> 1.16.x are allowed, however 1.14.x -> 1.16.x is not allowed. See [upgrading an AKS

                          with the same <major.minor> once it has been created (e.g. 1.14.x -> 1.14) will not trigger an upgrade, even if a newer
                          patch version is available. As a best practice, you should upgrade all node pools in an AKS cluster to the same
                          Kubernetes version. The node pool version must have the same major version as the control plane. The node pool minor

                    with the same <major.minor> once it has been created (e.g. 1.14.x -> 1.14) will not trigger an upgrade, even if a newer

                    upgrades must be performed sequentially by major version number. For example, upgrades between 1.14.x -> 1.15.x or
                    1.15.x -> 1.16.x are allowed, however 1.14.x -> 1.16.x is not allowed. See [upgrading an AKS

                    KubernetesVersion: When you upgrade a supported AKS cluster, Kubernetes minor versions cannot be skipped. All upgrades
                    must be performed sequentially by major version number. For example, upgrades between 1.14.x -> 1.15.x or 1.15.x ->
                    1.16.x are allowed, however 1.14.x -> 1.16.x is not allowed. See [upgrading an AKS
                    cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/upgrade-cluster) for more details.

                          with the same <major.minor> once it has been created (e.g. 1.14.x -> 1.14) will not trigger an upgrade, even if a newer
                          patch version is available. As a best practice, you should upgrade all node pools in an AKS cluster to the same
                          Kubernetes version. The node pool version must have the same major version as the control plane. The node pool minor

                          with the same <major.minor> once it has been created (e.g. 1.14.x -> 1.14) will not trigger an upgrade, even if a newer
                          patch version is available. As a best practice, you should upgrade all node pools in an AKS cluster to the same
                          Kubernetes version. The node pool version must have the same major version as the control plane. The node pool minor

                          the destination.

                    with the same <major.minor> once it has been created (e.g. 1.14.x -> 1.14) will not trigger an upgrade, even if a newer
                    patch version is available. As a best practice, you should upgrade all node pools in an AKS cluster to the same

                    When <major.minor> is specified, the latest supported GA patch version is chosen automatically. Updating the cluster
                    with the same <major.minor> once it has been created (e.g. 1.14.x -> 1.14) will not trigger an upgrade, even if a newer
                    patch version is available. As a best practice, you should upgrade all node pools in an AKS cluster to the same
                    Kubernetes version. The node pool version must have the same major version as the control plane. The node pool minor
                    version must be within two minor versions of the control plane version. The node pool version cannot be greater than the

                    with the same <major.minor> once it has been created (e.g. 1.14.x -> 1.14) will not trigger an upgrade, even if a newer
                    patch version is available. As a best practice, you should upgrade all node pools in an AKS cluster to the same
                    Kubernetes version. The node pool version must have the same major version as the control plane. The node pool minor

                    <major.minor> once it has been created will not trigger an upgrade, even if a newer patch version is available. As a
                    best practice, you should upgrade all node pools in an AKS cluster to the same Kubernetes version. The node pool version
                    must have the same major version as the control plane. The node pool minor version must be within two minor versions of
                    the control plane version. The node pool version cannot be greater than the control plane version. For more information

                    with the same <major.minor> once it has been created (e.g. 1.14.x -> 1.14) will not trigger an upgrade, even if a newer
                    patch version is available. As a best practice, you should upgrade all node pools in an AKS cluster to the same
                    Kubernetes version. The node pool version must have the same major version as the control plane. The node pool minor
