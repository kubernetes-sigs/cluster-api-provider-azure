                  succinct value suitable for machine interpretation. \n This field
                  should not be set for transitive errors that a controller faces
                  that are expected to be fixed automatically over time (like service
                  outages), but instead indicate that something is fundamentally wrong
                  with the MachinePool's spec or the configuration of the controller,
                  and that manual intervention is required. Examples of terminal errors
                  would be invalid combinations of settings in the spec, values that
                  are unsupported by the controller, or the responsible controller
                  itself being critically misconfigured. \n Any transient errors that
                  occur during the reconciliation of MachinePools can be added as
                  events to the MachinePool object and/or logged in the controller's
                  output."
