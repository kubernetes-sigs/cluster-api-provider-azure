                      description: |-
                        lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
                        This should be when the underlying condition changed. If that is not known, then using the time when
                        the API field changed is acceptable.

                        message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition.

                        reason is the reason for the condition's last transition in CamelCase.

                      description: |-
                        severity provides an explicit classification of Reason code, so the users or machines can immediately
                        understand the current situation and act accordingly.
                        The Severity field MUST be set only when Status=False.

                        type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase.
                        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions
                        can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.

                  ExternalManagedControlPlane indicates to cluster-api that the control plane
                  is managed by an external service such as AKS, EKS, GKE, etc.

                  FailureMessage will be set in the event that there is a terminal problem
                  reconciling the state and will be set to a descriptive error message.

                  This field should not be set for transitive errors that a controller
                  faces that are expected to be fixed automatically over
                  time (like service outages), but instead indicate that something is
                  fundamentally wrong with the spec or the configuration of
                  the controller, and that manual intervention is required.
