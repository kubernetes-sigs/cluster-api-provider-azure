## Prerequisites

### Requirements

- Linux or macOS (Windows isn't supported at the moment)
- A [Microsoft Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)
- Install the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
- Install the [Kubernetes CLI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [KIND]
- [kustomize]
- make
- gettext (with `envsubst` in your PATH)
- md5sum
- bazel

### Optional

- [Homebrew][brew] (MacOS)
- [jq]
- [Go]

[brew]: https://brew.sh/
[go]: https://golang.org/dl/
[jq]: https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/
[kind]: https://sigs.k8s.io/kind
[kustomize]: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize

### Setting up your Azure environment

An Azure Service Principal is needed for populating the controller manifests. This utilizes [environment-based authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/go/azure/azure-sdk-go-authorization#use-environment-based-authentication).

  1. List your Azure subscriptions.

   ```bash
  az account list -o table
   ```

  2. Save your Subscription ID in an environment variable.

  ```bash
  export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<SubscriptionId>"
  ```

  3. Create an Azure Service Principal by running the following command or skip this step and use a previously created Azure Service Principal.

  ```bash
  az ad sp create-for-rbac --name SPClusterAPI
  ```

  4. Save the output from the above command in environment variables.

  ```bash
  export AZURE_TENANT_ID=<Tenant>
  export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<AppId>
  export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<Password>
  export AZURE_LOCATION="eastus"
  ```
<!--An alternative is to install [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) and have the project's script create the service principal automatically. _Note that the service principals created by the scripts will not be deleted automatically._ -->

### Using images

By default, the code will use the Azure Marketplace "capi" offer. You can list the available images with:

```bash
az vm image list --publisher cncf-upstream --offer capi --all -o table
```

You can also [build your own image](https://image-builder.sigs.k8s.io/capi/providers/azure.html) and specify the image ID in the manifests generated in the AzureMachine specs.

## Troubleshooting

### Bootstrap running, but resources aren't being created

Logs can be tailed using [`kubectl`][kubectl-logs]:

```bash
kubectl logs azure-provider-controller-manager-0 -n azure-provider-system -f
```

### Resources are created but control plane is taking a long time to become ready

You can check the custom script logs by SSHing into the VM created and reading `/var/lib/waagent/custom-script/download/0/{stdout,stderr}`.
