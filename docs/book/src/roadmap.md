# Cluster API Azure Roadmap

The best place to see what's coming within a 1-2 month timeline is in [the public milestones](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-azure/milestones).
All open items for the the next numbered milestone (e.g. **1.15**) are visualized in the [Milestone-Open project board view](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes-sigs/projects/26/views/7) and planned at the very beginning of the 2-month release cycle. This planning and discussion begins at [Cluster API Azure Office Hours](http://bit.ly/k8s-capz-agenda) after a major release.
Active community PR contributions are prioritized throughout the release, but unplanned work will arise. Hence the items in the milestone are a rough estimate which may change.
The "next" milestone is a very rough collection of issues for the milestone after the current numbered one to help prioritize upcoming work.

## High Level Vision

CAPZ is the official production-ready Cluster API implementation to administer the entire lifecycle of self-managed or managed Kubernetes clusters (AKS) on Azure. Cluster API extends the Kubernetes API to provide tooling consistent across on-premises and cloud providers to build and maintain Kubernetes clusters at scale while working with GitOps and the surrounding tooling ecosystem. [See related blog post.](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2023/04/20/kubernetes-at-scale-with-gitops-and-cluster-api/)

## Long-Term Priorities

CAPZ can provision three major types of clusters, each of which have a different investment priority.

1. Self-Managed clusters - maintain the current functionality via bug fixes and security patches.  New features will be accepted via contributor pull requests.
2. Managed clusters (AzureManaged* current API) - maintain the current functionality via bug fixes and security patches.  New features will be accepted via contributor pull requests. It is recommended that the existing [asoManaged*Patches functionality](./managed/managedcluster.md#warning-warning-this-is-meant-to-be-used-sparingly-to-enable-features-for-development-and-testing-that-are-not-otherwise-represented-in-the-capz-api-misconfiguration-that-conflicts-with-capzs-normal-mode-of-operation-is-possible) be considered as a stop-gap to missing features in the CAPZ definitions for AKS.
See deprecation timeline below.
3. Managed clusters (AzureASOManaged* new API) - was moved out of experimentation in July for the 1.16 release and is where the investment lies moving forward for provisioning AKS clusters.

See the [managed clusters](./managed/managed.md) for further background and comparison of the two managed cluster APIs.

Approximate timeline for deprecation of AzureManaged API:
- Sept 2024 - 1.17 - Announcement of deprecation of AzureManaged API.
- Nov 2024 - 1.18
- Jan 2025 - 1.19 - move AzureASOManaged API to beta
- Mar 2025 - 1.20 - no new features accepted for AzureManaged API. Warning message in code for deprecation.
- May 2025 - 1.21 - GA AzureASOManaged API
- July 2025 - 1.22
- Sept 2025 - 1.23 - AzureManaged API is removed from code base, AzureASOManaged API is default.

There may be investment creating a new API definition for AKS from the [Managed Kubernetes CAPI proposal](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/blob/main/docs/proposals/20220725-managed-kubernetes.md) at some point in the future.  If interested in this functionality, please file an issue on the CAPZ repository and come to the community group meeting to discuss.
