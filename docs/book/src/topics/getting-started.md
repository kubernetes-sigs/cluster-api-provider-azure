# Getting started with cluster-api-provider-azure

## Prerequisites

### Requirements

- A [Microsoft Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)
- Install the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)

### Setting up your Azure environment

An Azure Service Principal is needed for deploying Azure resources. The below instructions utilize [environment-based authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/go/azure/azure-sdk-go-authorization#use-environment-based-authentication).

  1. Login with the Azure CLI.

   ```bash
  az login
   ```
  
  2. List your Azure subscriptions.

   ```bash
  az account list -o table
   ```

  3. If more than one account is present, select the account that you want to use.

   ```bash
  az account set -s <SubscriptionId>
   ```

  4. Save your Subscription ID in an environment variable.

  ```bash
  export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<SubscriptionId>"
  ```

  5. Create an Azure Service Principal by running the following command or skip this step and use a previously created Azure Service Principal.
  NOTE: the "owner" role is required to be able to create role assignments for [system-assigned managed identity](identity.md).

  ```bash
  az ad sp create-for-rbac --role contributor
  ```

  6. Save the output from the above command in environment variables.

  ```bash
  export AZURE_TENANT_ID="<Tenant>"
  export AZURE_CLIENT_ID="<AppId>"
  export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET='<Password>'
  export AZURE_LOCATION="eastus" # this should be an Azure region that your subscription has quota for.
  ```

<h1> Warning </h1>

NOTE: If your password contains single quotes (`'`), make sure to escape them. To escape a single quote, close the quoting before it, insert the single quote, and re-open the quoting.
For example, if your password is `foo'blah$`, you should do `export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET='foo'\''blah$'`.

The capability to set credentials using environment variables is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases, the recommended approach is to use `AzureClusterIdentity` as explained [here](multitenancy.md)

### Building your first cluster
