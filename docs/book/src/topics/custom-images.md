# Custom images

This document will help you get a CAPZ Kubernetes cluster up and running with your custom image.

## Reference images

An *image* defines the operating system and Kubernetes components that will populate the disk of each node in your cluster.

By default, images offered by "capi" in the [Azure Marketplace][azure-marketplace] are used. You can list these *reference images* with this command:

```bash
az vm image list --publisher cncf-upstream --offer capi --all -o table
```

Note: These images are not updated for security fixes and it is recommended to always use the latest patch version for the Kubernetes version you wish to run. For production-like environments, and for more control over your nodes, it is highly recommended to build and use your own custom images.

## Building a custom image

Cluster API uses the Kubernetes [Image Builder][image-builder] tools. You should use the [Azure images][image-builder-azure] from that project as a starting point for your custom image.

[The Image Builder Book][capi-images] explains how to build the images defined in that repository, with instructions for [Azure CAPI Images][azure-capi-images] in particular.

### Operating system requirements

For your custom image to work with Cluster API, it must meet the operating system requirements of the bootstrap provider. For example, the default `kubeadm` bootstrap provider has a set of [`preflight checks`][kubeadm-preflight-checks] that a VM is expected to pass before it can join the cluster.

### Kubernetes version requirements

The reference images are each built to support a specific version of Kubernetes. When using your custom images based on them, take care to match the image to the `version:` field of the `KubeadmControlPlane` and `MachineDeployment` in the YAML template for your workload cluster.

To upgrade to a new Kubernetes release with custom images requires this preparation:

- create a new custom image which supports the Kubernetes release version
- copy the existing `AzureMachineTemplate` and change its `image:` section to reference the new custom image
- create the new `AzureMachineTemplate` on the management cluster
- modify the existing `KubeadmControlPlane` and `MachineDeployment` to reference the new `AzureMachineTemplate` and update the `version:` field to match

See [Upgrading workload clusters][upgrading-workload-clusters] for more details.

## Creating a cluster from a custom image

To use a custom image, it needs to be referenced in an `image:` section of your `AzureMachineTemplate`. See below for more specific examples.

### Using Shared Image Gallery (Recommended)

To use an image from the [Shared Image Gallery][shared-image-gallery], fill in the `resourceGroup`, `name`, `subscriptionID`, `gallery`, and `version` fields:

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
kind: AzureMachineTemplate
metadata:
  name: capz-shared-gallery-example
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      image:
        sharedGallery:
          resourceGroup: "cluster-api-images"
          name: "capi-1234567890"
          subscriptionID: "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-4567890abcde"
          gallery: "ClusterAPI"
          version: "0.3.1234567890"
```

If you build Azure CAPI images with the `make` targets in Image Builder, these required values are printed after a successful build. For example:

```bash
$ make -C images/capi/ build-azure-sig-ubuntu-1804
# many minutes later...
==> sig-ubuntu-1804:
Build 'sig-ubuntu-1804' finished.

==> Builds finished. The artifacts of successful builds are:
--> sig-ubuntu-1804: Azure.ResourceManagement.VMImage:

OSType: Linux
ManagedImageResourceGroupName: cluster-api-images
ManagedImageName: capi-1234567890
ManagedImageId: /subscriptions/01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-4567890abcde/resourceGroups/cluster-api-images/providers/Microsoft.Compute/images/capi-1234567890
ManagedImageLocation: southcentralus
ManagedImageSharedImageGalleryId: /subscriptions/01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-4567890abcde/resourceGroups/cluster-api-images/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/ClusterAPI/images/capi-ubuntu-1804/versions/0.3.1234567890
```

Please also see the [replication recommendations][replication-recommendations] for the Shared Image Gallery.

If the image you want to use is based on an image released by a third party publisher such as for example 
`Flatcar Linux` by `Kinvolk`, then you need to specify the `publisher`, `offer`, and `sku` fields as well:

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
kind: AzureMachineTemplate
metadata:
  name: capz-shared-gallery-example
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      image:
        sharedGallery:
          resourceGroup: "cluster-api-images"
          name: "capi-1234567890"
          subscriptionID: "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-4567890abcde"
          gallery: "ClusterAPI"
          version: "0.3.1234567890"
          publisher: "kinvolk"
          offer: "flatcar-container-linux-free"
          sku: "stable"
```

This will make API calls to create Virtual Machines or Virtual Machine Scale Sets to have the `Plan` correctly set.

### Using image ID

To use a managed image resource by ID, only the `id` field must be set:

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
kind: AzureMachineTemplate
metadata:
  name: capz-image-id-example
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      image:
        id: "/subscriptions/01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-4567890abcde/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/images/myImage"
```

A managed image resource can be created from a Virtual Machine. Please refer to Azure documentation on [creating a managed image][creating-managed-image] for more detail.

Managed images support only 20 simultaneous deployments, so for most use cases Shared Image Gallery is recommended.

### Using Azure Marketplace

To use an image from [Azure Marketplace][azure-marketplace], populate the `publisher`, `offer`, `sku`, and `version` fields and, if this image is published by a third party publisher, set the `thirdPartyImage` flag to `true` so an image Plan can be generated for it. In the case of a third party image, you must accept the license terms with the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/vm/image/terms?view=azure-cli-latest) before consuming it.

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
kind: AzureMachineTemplate
metadata:
  name: capz-marketplace-example
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      image:
        marketplace:
          publisher: "example-publisher"
          offer: "example-offer"
          sku: "k8s-1dot18dot8-ubuntu-1804"
          version: "2020-07-25"
          thirdPartyImage: true
```
