# Release Process

Before beginning the release process, review and discuss any potential modifications to the [support matrix/policy][support-policy].

## Semi-automatic

1. Make sure your repo is clean by git's standards
2. If the controller has changed, it would be good to bump the version of the controller image. Look in `cmd/release/main.go`.
3. Run `go run cmd/release/main.go -version v0.x.y`, replacing the [version][versioning], as appropriate
4. Push the docker images that were generated with this release tool
5. Edit the release notes and make sure the binaries uploaded return the correct version
6. Publish release
7. [Announce][release-announcement] the release

## Manual

1. Tag the repository and push the tag
   - An [OWNER](/OWNERS) runs `git tag -s $VERSION` and inserts the changelog and pushes the tag with `git push $VERSION`
2. Create a draft release in GitHub and associate it with the tag that was just created
3. Checkout the tag and make sure git is in a clean state
4. Run `make release-artifacts`
5. Attach the tarball to the drafted release
6. Attach `clusterctl` to the drafted release (for darwin and linux architectures)
7. Write the [release notes](#release-notes)
8. Build and push the container image
9. Publish release
10. [Announce][release-announcement] the release

## Versioning

cluster-api-provider-azure follows the [semantic versionining][semver] specification.

As of this writing, we have not produced as a major or minor release. 

Current pre-release versions can be expected to have breaking changes as we move towards declaring a public API version.

Example versions:
- Pre-release: `v0.1.1-alpha.1`
- Minor release: `v0.1.0`
- Patch release: `v0.1.1`
- Major release: `v1.0.0`

## Expected artifacts

1. A container image containing the azure-provider manager binary
2. A release tarball containing the manifest-templates and a script to generate     the actual manifests
3. `clusterctl`
4. Release notes

## Output locations

### Container image

The container image will live in the registry `quay.io/k8s/cluster-api-provider-azure`
under the image name `cluster-api-azure-controller:<tag>` where `<tag>` is
replaced by the version being released.

### Manifests

Manifests must be generated by hand.

Running `make release-artifacts` will create a tarball that you can attach to
the drafted release.

### Binaries

The binary produced by a release is the `clusterctl` binary. There should be support for both darwin and linux architectures.

### Release Notes

Release notes are written by hand using the [release notes template][template] as a guide.

Generally, we'll make a [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) and share the release note
 responsibility for a few days in advance of the release.

The markdown is shared in the Kubernetes slack in the channel #cluster-api-azure.

## Communication

### Minor/Patch Releases

1. Announce the release in Kubernetes Slack on the #cluster-api-azure channel.
2. An announcement email is sent to `kubernetes-sig-azure@googlegroups.com` and `kubernetes-sig-cluster-lifecycle@googlegroups.com` with the subject `[ANNOUNCE] cluster-api-provider-azure $VERSION has been released`

### Major Releases

1. Follow the communications process for [pre-releases](#pre-releases)
2. An announcement email is sent to `kubernetes-dev@googlegroups.com` with the subject `[ANNOUNCE] cluster-api-provider-azure $VERSION has been released`
