# Overview

The Cluster API documentation is currently written in [Markdown][markdown]
and rendered into static HTML/CSS/JavaScript using [GitBook][gitbook] and various
[plugins][plugins]. It is automatically built using a [script](../../hack/build-gitbook.sh)
and continuously deployed using a shared Netlify account.

# Making changes

The GitBook source is located in [./docs/book](../../docs/book) and the static
content is generated into [./docs/book/_book](../../docs/book/_book) but not
checked into version control. Netlify will automatically rebuild the 
documentation on each merge to master.

## Testing locally

```
hack/build-gitbook.sh
```

## Verify the contents of the GitBook are correct by viewing the pages which 
should include new or changed content and:

0) Ensuring the expected changes are there.
1) They are rendered as expected.

```
cd docs/book
gitbook serve
# open localhost:4000 in a web browser
```

## Finally submit a PR
