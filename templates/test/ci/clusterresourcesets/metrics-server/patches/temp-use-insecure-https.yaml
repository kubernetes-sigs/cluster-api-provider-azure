# As there is a proposal to address this long term in CAPI 
# we are enabling the metric server flag --kubelet-insecure-tls 
# for the e2e tests with the plan to enable this customers 
# longer term with the CAPI solution. It is possible to write 
# a controller that would auto enable the CSR signing but would 
# be not relevant once the CAPI work is in place.
