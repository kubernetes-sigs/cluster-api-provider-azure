  # On Azure, the underlying network has an MTU of 1400, even though the network interface will have an MTU of 1500.
  # We set this value to 1350 for “physical network MTU size minus 50” since we use VXLAN, which uses a 50-byte header.
  # If enabling Wireguard, this value should be changed to 1340 (Wireguard uses a 60-byte header).
