Read the following guide if you're interested in contributing to cluster-api.

## Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your patches! Before we can take them, we have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement (CLA). More information about the CLA and instructions for signing it [can be found here](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/CLA.md).

***NOTE***: Only original source code from you and other people that have signed the CLA can be accepted into the repository.

## Finding Things That Need Help

If you're new to the project and want to help, but don't know where to start, we have a semi-curated list of issues that should not need deep knowledge of the system. [Have a look and see if anything sounds interesting](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-azure/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). Alternatively, read some of the docs on other controllers and try to write your own, file and fix any/all issues that come up, including gaps in documentation!

## Contributing a Patch

1. If you haven't already done so, sign a Contributor License Agreement (see details above).
1. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
1. Submit a pull request.
  1. All code PR must be labeled with
    ‚ö†Ô∏è (:warning:, major or breaking changes), ‚ú® (:sparkles:, minor or feature additions), üêõ (:bug:, patch and bugfixes), üìñ (:book:, documentation or proposals), or üèÉ (:running:, other)

All changes must be code reviewed. Coding conventions and standards are explained in the official [developer docs](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/devel). Expect reviewers to request that you avoid common [go style mistakes](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) in your PRs.

## Backporting a Patch

Cluster API ships older versions through `release-X.X` branches, usually backports are reserved to critical bug-fixes.
Some release branches might ship with both Go modules and dep (e.g. `release-0.1`), users backporting patches should always make sure
that the vendored Go modules dependencies match the Gopkg.lock and Gopkg.toml ones by running `dep ensure`

### Merge Approval

Cluster API maintainers may add "LGTM" (Looks Good To Me) or an equivalent comment to indicate that a PR is acceptable. Any change requires at least one LGTM.  No pull requests can be merged until at least one Cluster API maintainer signs off with an LGTM.

### Google Doc Viewing Permissions

To gain viewing permissions to google docs in this project, please join either the [kubernetes-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-dev) or [kubernetes-sig-cluster-lifecycle](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-cluster-lifecycle) google group.

### Issue and Pull Request Management

Anyone may comment on issues and submit reviews for pull requests. However, in
order to be assigned an issue or pull request, you must be a member of the
[Kubernetes SIGs](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs) GitHub organization.

If you are a Kubernetes GitHub organization member, you are eligible for
membership in the Kubernetes SIGs GitHub organization and can request
membership by [opening an issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/issues/new?template=membership.md&title=REQUEST%3A%20New%20membership%20for%20%3Cyour-GH-handle%3E)
against the kubernetes/org repo.

However, if you are a member of any of the related Kubernetes GitHub
organizations but not of the Kubernetes org, you will need explicit sponsorship
for your membership request. You can read more about Kubernetes membership and
sponsorship [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/community-membership.md).

Cluster API maintainers can assign you an issue or pull request by leaving a
`/assign <your Github ID>` comment on the issue or pull request.
